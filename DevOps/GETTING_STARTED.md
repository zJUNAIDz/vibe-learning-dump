# Getting Started with DevOps for Developers

> **Your roadmap to DevOps fluency**

---

## 🎯 What This Curriculum Covers

This is a **complete, production-grade DevOps curriculum** designed for software developers who want to:
- Deploy and manage production systems confidently
- Understand infrastructure, not just use it blindly
- Debug issues when things go wrong
- Collaborate effectively with DevOps/SRE teams

**This is NOT:**
- A pure infrastructure/SRE track
- Vendor-specific certification prep
- A collection of "just run this command" tutorials

**This IS:**
- First-principles explanations
- Real-world patterns and anti-patterns
- Developer-centric perspectives
- Platform-agnostic knowledge

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- ✅ Comfortable with command line (bash/zsh)
- ✅ Know at least one programming language (TypeScript or Go preferred)
- ✅ Basic Docker knowledge (can write a Dockerfile)
- ✅ Git basics

### Zero Experience Required In
- ❌ Kubernetes
- ❌ CI/CD pipelines
- ❌ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
- ❌ Production operations

---

## 🛠️ Setup Your Environment

### 1. Operating System
This curriculum assumes **Linux** (Fedora 39+). If you're on Windows or macOS:

**Windows:**
```bash
# Use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
wsl --install -d Fedora
```

**macOS:**
- Most commands work as-is
- Some systemd stuff won't apply (macOS uses launchd)
- Use Homebrew for package management

---

### 2. Essential Tools

```bash
# Update system
sudo dnf update -y

# Install essentials
sudo dnf install -y \
    git \
    curl \
    wget \
    vim \
    htop \
    tmux \
    jq \
    tree

# Docker/Podman (Fedora includes Podman)
podman --version
# If you prefer Docker:
# sudo dnf install docker
# sudo systemctl enable --now docker

# kubectl
sudo dnf install kubernetes-client

# minikube (local Kubernetes)
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

# k9s (Kubernetes TUI)
sudo dnf install k9s

# Terraform
sudo dnf install terraform

# Ansible
sudo dnf install ansible
```

---

### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
# Docker/Podman
podman run --rm hello-world

# Kubernetes (minikube)
minikube start
kubectl get nodes

# Tools
terraform --version
ansible --version
k9s version
```

### Reading Strategy

Each module contains:
- **Concepts** — Why things exist, how they work
- **Commands** — Practical examples you can run
- **War Stories** — Real production failures
- **Exercises** — Hands-on practice

**Recommended approach:**
1. Read the concept
2. Run the commands (in a VM or test cluster!)
3. Do the exercises
4. Break things intentionally (learn faster)
5. Move to next section

**DO NOT:**
- Just read without practicing
- Copy-paste without understanding
- Skip the "boring" foundational stuff
- Rush through to "the cool Kubernetes stuff"

---

## 🎓 Study Schedule Suggestions

### Intensive (2 weeks, full-time)
- 6-8 hours/day
- Complete one major module per day
- Not recommended (burnout risk)

### Moderate (6-8 weeks, part-time)
- 2-3 hours/day, 5 days/week
- Complete one module per week
- **Recommended for most people**

### Relaxed (3-4 months, casual)
- 1 hour/day, 3-4 days/week
- Complete one module every 2 weeks
- Good for busy professionals

---

## 💡 Learning Tips

### 1. Use a Dedicated Lab Environment

**Don't practice on production!**

Options:
- Local VM (VirtualBox, VMware)
- Cloud VM (AWS EC2 t3.micro is cheap)
- Local Kubernetes (minikube, kind)

**Snapshot before experiments:**
```bash
# minikube
minikube stop
# Create VM snapshot manually

# Docker
docker commit <container> my-snapshot
```

---

### 2. Keep a Learning Journal

Document:
- Commands that worked
- Errors you encountered (and how you fixed them)
- "Aha!" moments
- Questions to research later

**Example format:**
```markdown
## 2026-02-21: Kubernetes Pods

### What I learned:
- Pods are ephemeral
- Deployments manage pods
- Never deploy pods directly

### Error I hit:
ImagePullBackOff — wrong image name

### Fixed by:
Checked spelling, updated deployment YAML

### Questions:
- How does Kubernetes actually schedule pods?
  (Answer in next section: Scheduler component)
```

---

### 3. Join Communities

- **Reddit:** r/kubernetes, r/devops
- **Discord:** Kubernetes, DevOps communities
- **Stack Overflow:** Tag: kubernetes, docker, terraform
- **Twitter/X:** Follow #DevOps, #Kubernetes hashtags

**Ask questions when stuck!**

---

### 4. Use the Quick Reference

The [`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md) file contains:
- Common commands
- Syntax patterns
- Debugging workflows

Print it out, keep it open in a tab, whatever works.

---

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls

### 1. Skipping the Fundamentals
**Don't skip Module 01 (Linux & Systems).**

"I just want to learn Kubernetes" → you'll struggle when pods won't start and you don't understand cgroups, namespaces, or process signals.

---

### 2. Not Actually Running Commands
Reading ≠ Learning.

**Bad:**
- Read about `kubectl get pods`
- "Yeah, I get it"
- Move on

**Good:**
- Read about `kubectl get pods`
- Run it in your cluster
- Try `kubectl get pods -o yaml`
- Try `kubectl describe pod <name>`
- Break a pod, see what happens

---

### 3. Using `latest` Tag in Production
(You'll learn why this is bad in Module 02)

---

### 4. Committing Secrets to Git
(You'll learn alternatives in Module 14)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Command not found"
```bash
# Verify installation
which kubectl
which terraform

# Add to PATH if needed
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

### "Permission denied"
```bash
# Docker/Podman needs sudo (or add user to docker group)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

# Or just use sudo
sudo docker ps
```

### "Kubernetes cluster not reachable"
```bash
# Is minikube running?
minikube status

# Start if needed
minikube start

# Check kubectl config
kubectl config current-context
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you're stuck or have questions about the curriculum itself:

1. **Check the module README** — each module has troubleshooting tips

---

**Remember:** 
- DevOps is a journey, not a destination
- Everyone struggles at first (especially with Kubernetes)
- Break things in test environments — that's how you learn
- Ask questions — the community is helpful
- Have fun (seriously, this stuff is cool!)

**Good luck!** 🎉
