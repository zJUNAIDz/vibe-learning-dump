# Module 02: Blockchain Data Structures

## Blocks, Chains, and Merkle Trees

---

## Overview

This module covers the fundamental data structures that make blockchains work:
- Blocks (what they contain)
- Chains (how blocks link together)
- Merkle trees (efficient verification)
- Why immutability matters

**Goal:** Understand blockchains as data structures, not magic.
