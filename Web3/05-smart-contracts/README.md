# Module 05: Smart Contracts Fundamentals

**Focus:** What smart contracts actually are (and aren't).

---

## What You'll Learn

The term "smart contract" is misleading. They're neither smart nor contracts. This module demystifies what they really are: **deterministic programs that execute on-chain**.

## Lessons

1. **[What Smart Contracts Really Are](01-what-smart-contracts-are.md)** 🟢
   - Not AI, not legal contracts
   - Deterministic programs
   - Immutability implications

2. **[The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)](02-evm-basics.md)** 🟡
   - Stack-based VM
   - Opcodes and gas costs
   - Why it's slow

3. **[Contract Lifecycle](03-contract-lifecycle.md)** 🟡
   - Deployment (creation tx)
   - Interaction (call vs send)
   - Self-destruct (deprecated)

4. **[Storage vs Memory vs Stack](04-storage-memory-stack.md)** 🔴
   - Persistent storage (expensive)
   - Temporary memory
   - Gas implications

5. **[Determinism and Limitations](05-determinism-limits.md)** 🔴
   - No randomness
   - No external API calls
   - Oracles as workaround
