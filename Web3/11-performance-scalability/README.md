# Module 11: Performance and Scalability

**Focus:** Why blockchains are slow and how we're (trying to) fix it.

---

## What You'll Learn

Blockchains don't scale. This isn't a bug; it's a fundamental tradeoff. This module explains why and explores the solutions (spoiler: they all have tradeoffs too).

## Lessons

1. **[The Scalability Trilemma](01-trilemma.md)** 🟢
   - Can't have all three: Security, Decentralization, Scalability
   - Bitcoin: 7 TPS
   - Ethereum: 15 TPS
   - Why centralized databases do millions of TPS

2. **[Layer 2 Solutions](02-layer-2.md)** 🟡
   - Rollups (Optimistic vs ZK)
   - State channels
   - Sidechains
   - Tradeoffs of each

3. **[Sharding](03-sharding.md)** 🟡
   - Data availability
   - Cross-shard communication
   - Ethereum's roadmap

4. **[Alternative Consensus](04-alt-consensus.md)** 🔴
   - High-performance chains (Solana, Avalanche)
   - Tradeoffs they make
   - Centralization risks

5. **[Gas Optimization](05-gas-optimization.md)** 🔴
   - Storage optimization
   - Batching operations
   - When optimization matters
