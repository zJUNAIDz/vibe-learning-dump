# Module 01: Cryptography Primer

## Only the Crypto You Need

---

## Overview

This module covers the cryptographic primitives used in Web3:
- Hash functions
- Public/private key cryptography
- Digital signatures
- Why wallets exist

**Goal:** Understand crypto as a tool, not as math worship.

---

## Module Contents

   - Properties (collision resistance, etc.)
   - How blockchains use hashes

2. **[Public-Private Key Cryptography](02-public-private-keys.md)**
   - Asymmetric encryption
   - Key pairs
   - Addresses

3. **[Digital Signatures](03-digital-signatures.md)**
   - How signing works
   - Verification
   - Why signatures matter in Web3

4. **[Wallets and Key Management](04-wallets-and-keys.md)**
   - What wallets actually do
   - Seed phrases
   - Deterministic wallets (HD wallets)

5. **[What Crypto Does NOT Protect](05-what-crypto-does-not-protect.md)**
   - Limitations
   - Common misconceptions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- ✅ Understand how hash functions secure blockchains
- ✅ Explain public/private key cryptography
- ✅ Understand how digital signatures authenticate transactions
- ✅ Know what wallets control (and don't control)
- ✅ Recognize the limits of cryptography

## Time Estimate

**Reading:** 3-4 hours  
**Exercises:** 1-2 hours  
**Total:** 4-6 hours

---

## Prerequisites

- Module 00: Orientation
- Basic programming knowledge (you don't need to be a math expert)

---

## Important Note

You do NOT need to understand the mathematical proofs behind these algorithms. You only need to understand:
- What they do
- What properties they have
- How Web3 uses them
