# Module 03: Consensus

## Agreeing Without Trust

---

## Overview

This is the **most important module** for understanding why blockchains work the way they do.

**Consensus** is how nodes agree on state when:
- Participants don't trust each other
- Some participants may be malicious
- Network delays exist
- No central authority exists

---

## Module Contents

1. **[The Byzantine Generals Problem](01-byzantine-generals.md)**
   - The core distributed systems problem
   - Why traditional consensus doesn't work for blockchains

2. **[Proof of Work (PoW)](02-proof-of-work.md)**
   - How Bitcoin achieves consensus
   - Mining, difficulty, security

3. **[Proof of Stake (PoS)](03-proof-of-stake.md)**
   - How Ethereum achieves consensus
   - Validators, slashing, finality

4. **[Comparing Consensus Mechanisms](04-comparing-consensus.md)**
   - PoW vs PoS vs others
   - Tradeoffs and attack vectors

5. **[Finality](05-finality.md)**
   - What finality means
   - Probabilistic vs absolute finality
   - Why confirmations matter

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- ✅ Understand the Byzantine Generals Problem
- ✅ Explain how Proof of Work achieves consensus
- ✅ Explain how Proof of Stake achieves consensus
- ✅ Compare consensus mechanisms critically
- ✅ Understand finality and confirmation depth

---

## Time Estimate

**Reading:** 4-5 hours  
**Exercises:** 2 hours  
**Total:** 6-7 hours

---

## Prerequisites

- Module 00: Orientation
- Module 01: Cryptography Primer
- Module 02: Blockchain Data Structures (especially hash chains and PoW)

---

## Why This Module Matters

**Consensus is the hard part.**

- Cryptography (Module 01): Solved problem
- Data structures (Module 02): Well understood
- **Consensus (Module 03): Active research area, fundamental tradeoffs**

Without understanding consensus, you can't understand:
- Why blockchains are slow
- Why they're expensive
- Why decentralization is hard
