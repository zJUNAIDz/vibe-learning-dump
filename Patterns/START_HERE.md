## How to Read Each Pattern

1. Read **The Problem** narrative first. Try to think about how YOU would solve it.
2. Read **Naïve Solutions** — did you think of the same approaches?
3. Read **The Insight** — this is the "aha" moment.
4. **The Pattern** formalizes what you just understood intuitively.
5. Study the **Mermaid diagram** — trace through the flow.
6. Read the **code examples** — run them if you can.
7. Read **Gotchas** — this is what separates knowing a pattern from using it well.
8. **Related patterns** — understand the landscape.
9. **Wrong choice** — know when to walk away.
